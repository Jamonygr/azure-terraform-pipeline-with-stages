Terraform Azure DevOps Pipeline
This Terraform Azure DevOps Pipeline is designed to manage infrastructure as code for Azure resources. It has two main stages: Terraform Init and Plan, and Terraform Apply. The pipeline uses the Terraform AzureRM provider to interact with Azure resources.

Stages
Terraform Init and Plan: This stage initializes the Terraform backend and generates an execution plan. It includes the following jobs:

Install Terraform
Checkout repository
Terraform Init
Terraform Validate
Terraform Plan
Publish Artifact: tfplan
Terraform Apply: This stage applies the generated execution plan to create, update, or delete the desired infrastructure. It includes the following jobs:

Install Terraform
Checkout repository
Download Artifact: tfplan
Terraform Init
Terraform Apply
Prerequisites
A Terraform configuration file in your repository.
An Azure DevOps project with a build pipeline configured.
An Azure subscription and a Service Principal with sufficient permissions to create, modify, and delete resources in the subscription.
Usage
Add the contents of the provided YAML file to your Azure DevOps build pipeline.
Configure the necessary variables in your build pipeline:
serviceName: The name of the Azure DevOps Service Principal.
remoteStateContainer: The name of the Azure Storage container where Terraform state files will be stored.
storageAccessKey: The access key for the Azure Storage account where the Terraform state files will be stored.
Commit your Terraform configuration file to the repository.
Run the build pipeline to create, update, or delete infrastructure as specified in your Terraform configuration file.
Notes
This pipeline assumes that you are using Azure Blob Storage for remote state management. If you are using a different backend, you will need to adjust the pipeline accordingly.
The pipeline uses the latest version of Terraform. If you need a specific version, change the terraformVersion input in the TerraformInstaller@0 tasks.
This pipeline uses the AzureRM provider for Terraform. If you are using a different provider, you will need to adjust the pipeline accordingly.
